# Learning C# and .NET

## Why?

I created this repository to document my takes on what I learn about C# and .NET through my career. So it can help myself later to review and improve them. This might get also helpful for someone else through the time.

## Examples

### Variance and LSP
These are very related concepts and also sometimes very tricky to grasp. So created some demos and examples to understand it better.
